# DataManagementPlan


DMP templates and questionnaires are implemented in [Data Stewarship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/). There is work planned to make the templates interoperable with [DMP OPIDoR](https://dmp.opidor.fr) so that they can be imported in that tool.

There will be two outcomes: the first one is a DMP template for FBI, affiliated facilities, and more generally any infrastructure or service handling data.  The second are the guidelines and recommandations to help users in filling the DMP.
A tutorial (in French) is available in this [repository](https://github.com/France-Bio-Imaging-Data/DataManagementPlan/blob/main/TutorielCreerVotrePGDdeStructureBioImage.md).


To post issues and questions Comment on recommandations/fields and  report issues on this questionnaire [here](https://gitlab.com/ifb-elixirfr/fair/gt2-is1-mudis4ls/gt2/-/issues).
